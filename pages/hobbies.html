    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><h2>Video Games</h2><p>Ive spent most of my childhood playing videogames and its a passion that has been following me since, its thanks to videogames that i started getting interested into tech.</p></li>
        <li><h2>Coding</h2><p>In my free time i try to code as much as i can even if im still a beginner,
             i enjoy spending time trying to solve a porblem and the thinking process that is required to achieve a solution,
              its feels super rewarding being able to solve a problem, 
              i also try to learn how to code and solve problems because it would allow me to feed my other hobbies such as videogames and understand the whole process behind the videogames i play, 
              one of my goals in this programming journey is being able to develop some personal utility programs that i might be needing, develop a homebrew for my childhood portable console(psvita),
               and  developing a game without using a game engine.</p></li>
        <li><h2>Football</h2><p>Ive been playing football since i was six, its a sport that helped me make a lot of close friends which i still talk to nowadays and it also helped me to stay fit.</p></li>
        <li><h2>Fashion</h2><p>I dont consider fashion as one of my main hobbies,however i love fashion as it helped me make my own identity</p></li>
    </ul>
